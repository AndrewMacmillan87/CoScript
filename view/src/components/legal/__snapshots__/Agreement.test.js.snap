      This area provides information on how you can draft up a Collaborative Writers Agreement, and the reasons why you may want to do so. This may not be something that every user feels is necessary, but for some users it could provide an extra layer of security and comfort whilst working with others. Please be considerate when working with other people, and if you feel that a formal agreement will help this process then follow the links to learn how to put an agreement in place.
